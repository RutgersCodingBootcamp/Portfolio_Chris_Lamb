# Portfolio Website

This Repository contains the website for my portfolio.

It contains an about me section that has my profile picture and a small snippit of information about myself.

The Nav bar at the top links between the three pages "Home", "Contact", and "Portfolio".

I left the portfolio piece empty because I will add items to it as I continue to develop as a developer.
